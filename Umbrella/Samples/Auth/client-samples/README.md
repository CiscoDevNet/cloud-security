# Cisco Umbrella Authorization Client Samples

The Umbrella authorization client samples enable you to programmatically send requests to the Umbrella Reporting API. The code demonstrates how to manage authorization through the OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow framework. Each code sample:

- Initializes a standards-based HTTP client.
- Initializes an OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow to create and refresh an access token.
- Creates and sends a sample request to the Umbrella Reporting API.

**Note:** The authorization clients are samples. You can adapt the sample code to create a request to any Umbrella API endpoint.

## Prerequisites

* You must create an Umbrella API key with the `reports` scope enabled. For more information, see [Cloud Security API Documentation](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/cloud-security/).
