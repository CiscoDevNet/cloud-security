# Cisco Umbrella Authorization Client Samples

The Umbrella authorization client code samples enable you to programmatically send requests to the Umbrella Reporting v2 API. The code manages authorization through the OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow framework. Each code sample:

- Initializes a standards-based HTTP client.
- Initializes an OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow to create and refresh an access token.
- Creates and sends a sample request to the Umbrella Reporting v2 API.

**Note:** You can adapt the client samples to create a request to any Umbrella Reporting v2 API endpoint.

## Prerequisites

* You must create an Umbrella Reporting API key and secret.
