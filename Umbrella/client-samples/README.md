# Cisco Umbrella Client Samples

The Umbrella client code samples enable you to programmatically send requests to the Umbrella Reporting v2 API and manage authorization through the OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow framework. Each code sample:

- Initializes a standards-based HTTP client.
- Initializes an OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow to create and refresh an access token.
- Creates and sends a sample request to the Umbrella Reporting v2 API.

**Note:** You can only use the client authorization samples with the Umbrella Reporting v2 API.
