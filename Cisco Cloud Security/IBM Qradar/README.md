# Preparations and Prerequisites
Please first review 1.4. Prerequisites in the product guide.
 
The Cisco Cloud Security App for IBM Qradar includes three different modules for three of the Cisco Cloud Security products. You do not have to have all three products and can use different combinations of them, but please first make sure that you have the necessary perquisites for the products you do have, as you will need these when installing the app:
 
## For Cisco Umbrella
https://support.umbrella.com/hc/en-us/articles/231248448-Cisco-Umbrella-Log-Management-in-Amazon-S3
 
## For Cisco Umbrella Enforcement API
https://docs.umbrella.com/enforcement-api/reference/
 
## For Cisco Investigate API
https://docs.umbrella.com/investigate-api/docs
 
## For Cisco Cloudlock API
Please see the Authentication section for instructions on how to generate your API token.
Also - in order for the Cisco Cloud Security App for IBM Qradar to access Cisco Cloudlock's API, we will need to whitelist your Qradars servers external IP address/es or range (if this has not already been done). You can whitelist these within the Cisco Cloudlock User Interface under the Authentication & API tab in the Settings page (which is also where you will generate your API token).
