# Cisco Cloud Security Client Samples

With the Cloud Security sample clients, you can programmatically create and manage access to the Umbrella Reporting v2 API through the OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow framework. Each code sample:

- Initializes a standards-based HTTP client.
- Initializes an OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow to create and refresh an access token.
- Creates and sends a sample request to the Umbrella Reporting v2 API.

**Note:** You can only use the client authorization samples with the Reporting v2 API.
